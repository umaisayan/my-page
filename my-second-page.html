        <p> An Oriental rug is a heavy textile made for a variety of utili
        tarian 
        and symbolic purposes and originating from a re
        gion known as the Rug
        Belt, which stretches from Morocco across North Africa, the Middle
        East, and into Central Asia and northern India. 
        The rugs can be pi
        le-woven or flat-woven without pile, using various materials such 
        as silk, wool, cotton, jute and animal hair. The
        origin of the Ori
        ental rug is unknown, although it is likely to hav
        e developed from 
        earlier floor coverings made of felt. This French
        poster, titled
               "A La Place Clichy and produced around 1891 to advertise Oriental
                rugs, features a lithograph by the Swiss artist Eugène 
             Grasset</p>
